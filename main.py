## Introduction
Instruct ChatGPT to create a lengthy, well laid out, extensive Manim script that elegantly demonstrates a mathematical concept or problem. keep in mind the dimensions of the window.
IMPORTANT - it is Create() not ShowCreation()
## Overall Structure
Specify the general structure of the script.

1. **Set Up the Scene**:
   - Define the scene and its properties.
   - Create any necessary objects.
   - Ensure all objects are instances of `Mobject` or its subclasses.
   - Position objects to avoid overlap.Keep space between words. Load all symbols properly. Global text size is small but legible in such a way that the text does not leave the border. Have enough checks to ensure nothing is going out of boundary.

2. **Display Mathematical Content**:
   - Include relevant equations or mathematical expressions using `MathTex`.
   - Ensure proper formatting, including LaTeX when applicable. Avoid LaTeX compilation errors in all cases. No "Undefined control sequence." Avoid in all cases please.
   - Animate or display mathematical content as needed.
   
3. **Provide Explanations**:
   - Include step-by-step explanations with `MathTex` formatting.
   - Use text boxes, labels, or annotations to clarify concepts.
   - Position text to avoid overlap with other elements.

4. **Transition Effects**:
   - Add transition effects between scenes or elements.
   - Specify the timing and duration of animations.
   - Ensure that animation targets are valid `Mobject` instances.

5. **Customization** (optional):
   - Allow for any customizations or variations based on specific examples or preferences.

6. **Quality and Layout**:
   - Ensure a clear layout with appropriate spacing.
   - Adjust the rendering quality for optimal viewing.
   - Check for compatibility with your chosen Manim version.

7. **Debugging and Troubleshooting**:
   - Include instructions on handling common errors, such as LaTeX-related issues.
   - Verify that all objects used for animations are of the correct type (`Mobject` or subclasses).
   - Double-check the inheritance of custom objects to ensure compatibility.

## Example Script
Provide a complete example script based on the instructions above. Keep everything inside the window. Do your best.

```python

from manim import *
# Increase the resolution and window size MANDATORY
config.pixel_height = 1080
config.pixel_width = 1920
config.frame_height = 6.0
config.frame_width = 6.0


class MyMathAnimation(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Set Up the Scene
        # Define the scene properties and create objects.

        # Example: Create a triangle
        triangle = Polygon(
            ORIGIN, RIGHT * 2, UP * 2,
        )
# Incorrect (causes the error):
my_object.color = RED

# Correct:
my_object.set_color(RED)

# Incorrect
ShowCreation() # is not defined

#Correct
Create()

        # Position the triangle
        triangle.move_to(LEFT * 2)

        # Display Mathematical Content
        # Include equations or expressions using `MathTex`.

        # Example: Add a mathematical expression
        expression = MathTex("E = \\frac{m \\cdot c^2}{\\quad\\quad}")


        # Position the equation below the triangle
        equation.next_to(triangle, DOWN)

        # Provide Explanations
        # Add step-by-step explanations with `MathTex` formatting.

        # Example: Add an explanation
        explanation = MathTex("This equation is known as Euler's identity.")

        # Position the explanation below the equation
        explanation.next_to(equation, DOWN)

        # Transition Effects
        # Specify animations and transitions between scenes.

        # Example: Animate the creation of objects
        self.play(Create(triangle))

        # Example: Animate the appearance of equations
        self.play(Write(equation))

        # Example: Animate explanations
        self.play(Write(explanation))

        # Customization (optional)
        # Allow for any customizations or variations.

        # Quality and Layout
        # Ensure clear layout and adjust rendering quality.

        # Debugging and Troubleshooting
        # Include instructions for handling errors.
        # Correct usage with two arguments (real and imag)
my_complex_number = complex(2.0, 3.0)

# Correct usage with one argument (real, imag defaults to 0)
my_complex_number = complex(2.0)

# Incorrect usage with more than two arguments (causes the error)
my_complex_number = complex(2.0, 3.0, 4.0)  # This will raise "complex() takes at most 2 arguments (3 given)"
# if text length more than 30 characters, break it and start at new line. do not exceed boundaries.
